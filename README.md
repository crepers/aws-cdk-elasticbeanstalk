# Welcome to your CDK TypeScript project

You should explore the contents of this project. It demonstrates a CDK app with an instance of a stack (`AwsCdkElasticbeanstalkStack`)
which contains an Amazon SQS queue that is subscribed to an Amazon SNS topic.

The `cdk.json` file tells the CDK Toolkit how to execute your app.

### Prerequisites

- AWS CDK CLI: The AWS CDK Toolkit, the CLI command cdk , is the primary tool for interacting with your AWS CDK app.

In this project root directory, execute the following commands:

### Deployment Steps
